# 📘 Class Notebooks – Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

This repository collects a series of notebooks I created during my academic training, solving practical exercises assigned in class. The content covers essential areas of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision, using tools such as PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and NumPy.

These are not fully developed projects from scratch, but rather individual solutions based on the exercises provided by instructors in various subjects. Each notebook documents the problem-solving approach, the techniques applied, and—in some cases—my own extensions to enhance or experiment with the results.
